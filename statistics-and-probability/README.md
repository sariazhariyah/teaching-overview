## Course Description
**Prerequisites:** Discrete Mathematics and Applied Mathematics  

This course introduces the fundamental concepts of statistics and probability. Students will learn central tendency, dispersion, probability theory, probability distributions, regression analysis, and hypothesis testing. By the end of the course, students are expected to apply statistical methods to solve real-world problems and support organizational decision-making using information and communication technologies.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, students are expected to:  
- Compute and interpret measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode).  
- Compute and interpret measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation).  
- Explain and apply fundamental probability concepts.  
- Conduct regression analysis and make decisions using statistical hypothesis tests.  
- Apply statistical concepts and probability distributions (discrete and continuous) to organizational and technological problem-solving.
