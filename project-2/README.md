## Program Description

The Information Systems Program is designed to equip graduates with knowledge and skills in designing and managing information systems.

### Vision

By 2030, to become one of the best Information Systems programs in Indonesia, supporting the development of the national industry.

### Mission

- To provide high-quality learning processes with continuous improvements relevant to stakeholder needs in information systems.
- To develop applied research in information systems.
- To implement community service in information systems to improve resources and community welfare.
- To foster collaborations with industry, associations, and institutions to produce professional, entrepreneurial, and ethical graduates.

## Course Description

- Prerequisites: Programming Fundamentals 1 & 2, Database Systems, SIM, and Project 1

This course aims to provide students with the ability to work collaboratively in teams to design and implement digital information systems in web, desktop, and mobile platforms. Students are required to apply concepts of software engineering, analysis, and system design to develop practical projects that reflect real-world applications. The course emphasizes technical documentation, teamwork, communication, and project management skills.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students are expected to:

- Work collaboratively in teams to complete medium-scale projects.
- Analyze business processes and translate them into system requirements.
- Design and implement digital information systems using appropriate methods and tools.
- Prepare and present technical documents such as SRS (Software Requirement Specification) and system design documentation.
- Manage group tasks effectively and produce comprehensive written reports.
- Demonstrate responsibility for personal tasks and accountability for team achievements.
