# 💻 Desktop Programming 

This repository contains **tutorial materials and code skeletons** for the course **Pemrograman Berbasis Desktop**

The goal of this repository is to provide **structured examples** and **template code** that help students learn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and Java fundamentals through practical, console-based applications.

---

## 📚 Course Overview
The course introduces the fundamentals of desktop-based programming using **Java** as the main language.  
Students will explore:
- Core Java syntax (data types, variables, conditions, and loops)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- Arrays and string manipulation
- Exception handling and file I/O
- Application structure using classes and methods

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
After completing all tasks, students should be able to:
1. Implement **object-oriented design** using classes, objects, methods, and attributes.
2. Apply **decision structures** (`if`, `switch`) and **looping** (`for`, `while`, `do-while`) effectively.
3. Handle **arrays**, **exceptions**, and **file operations**.
4. Develop small but complete **console-based applications** following clean code practices.

## 🧱 How to Use the Skeleton Files
Each task folder includes:
- A **skeleton code (`.java`)** with `// TODO` comments to guide your completion.
- A **README.md** explaining the objectives and requirements.
- An optional **sample-output.txt** to visualize expected results.

To run the Java files locally:
```bash
javac DesktopTask1_Skeleton.java
java DesktopTask1_Skeleton
