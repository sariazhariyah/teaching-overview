## Final Project (Capstone)

- Study Program: Information Systems
- Credits: 4 (Practical)
- Total Duration: 1 Semester (equivalent to 16â€“18 weeks)
- Teaching Method: Project-Based Learning (case study, mentoring, consultation, documentation, presentation)
- Learning Management System (LMS): Sharepoint (Weekly reports, milestones, reflection logs) + Microsoft Teams/Email for consultation

## Program Description

The Final Project (Capstone) course serves as the culmination of the Information Systems Program, enabling students to integrate and apply the knowledge, skills, and competencies gained throughout their studies. Unlike internships, this course emphasizes independent project development based on real-world cases drawn from industry, government, or community settings.

Students are expected to identify relevant problems, analyze requirements, design and develop information system solutions, and present their findings in a structured academic and professional manner. The course promotes both technical depth and social impact, preparing graduates to be innovative problem solvers.

## Course Description

- Prerequisites: Completion of all core courses in Information Systems, including Programming, Database, Systems Analysis & Design, and Software Engineering.

This course requires students to select or be assigned a project case from industry or the community. Under the guidance of an academic supervisor, students work on the following:

- Problem identification and requirements analysis.
- System design (processes, models, and architecture).
- Prototype development or system implementation.
- Testing and validation (including feedback from stakeholders).
- Documentation of progress and final reporting.
- Progress is reported weekly through the LMS and discussed during supervisory consultations.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- Identify and analyze problems in industry or society that can be solved using information systems.
- Document system requirements and propose feasible solutions.
- Design and develop prototypes or implement system solutions.
- Apply appropriate testing and validation methods to evaluate system functionality.
- Demonstrate project management, teamwork, and professional communication skills.
- Deliver academic reports and professional presentations that reflect applied knowledge.

## Notes & Policies

- Attendance: Students must attend scheduled consultations. Missed sessions must be justified and rescheduled.
- Reports: Weekly progress reports are required via Sharepoint.
- Consultation: Students are expected to maintain regular contact with their supervisors.
- Evaluation: Assessment is based on project milestones, supervisor evaluations, documentation quality, and final defense.
- Ethics: Academic integrity, originality, and professional behavior are mandatory. Plagiarism or unethical conduct will result in academic penalties.
