## Program Description

The Information Systems Program is designed to equip graduates with knowledge and skills in designing and managing information systems.

### Vision

By 2030, to become one of the best Information Systems programs in Indonesia, supporting the development of the national industry.

### Mission

- To provide high-quality learning processes with continuous improvements relevant to stakeholder needs in information systems.
- To develop applied research in information systems.
- To implement community service in information systems to improve resources and community welfare.
- To foster collaborations with industry, associations, and institutions to produce professional, entrepreneurial, and ethical graduates.

## Course Description

- Prerequisites: None

This course provides an introduction to fundamental programming concepts and algorithm design. Students will learn how to write structured programs using pseudocode, flowcharts, and a programming language. Topics include data types, variables, operators, expressions, sequential structures, decision-making, and loops. The course emphasizes problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking as the foundation for more advanced programming courses.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students are expected to:
- Understand the concept of algorithms and their representation (description, flowchart, pseudocode).
- Use data types, variables, operators, and expressions to build programs.
- Implement sequential, selection, and iteration structures in programming.
- Apply problem-solving techniques using algorithm design and structured programming.
- Develop basic programming skills through hands-on lab practice.
