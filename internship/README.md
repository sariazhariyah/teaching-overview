### Vision

By 2030, to become one of the best Information Systems programs in Indonesia, contributing to digital transformation and sustainable industrial growth.

### Mission

- To provide high-quality learning experiences through academicâ€“industry collaboration.
- To develop graduates who are adaptive, entrepreneurial, and professional in applying information systems.
- To strengthen applied research and community engagement by integrating industrial cases into academic settings.
- To build sustainable partnerships with industry, government, and professional associations.

## Course Description

- Prerequisites: Completion of all fundamental courses in Information Systems, including Programming, Database, and Systems Analysis & Design.

This course provides students with professional experience through placement in industry or relevant institutions. Students are required to document system requirements, analyze existing workflows, evaluate data models (conceptual, logical, physical), design improved business processes, implement system prototypes, and perform User Acceptance Testing (UAT).

## Learning Outcomes:

By the end of the course, students are expected to:
- Document information system requirements in a professional setting.
- Analyze and evaluate current system workflows and data models.
- Design business processes to be developed and propose system improvements.
- Implement system prototypes and conduct testing with end-users (UAT).
- Demonstrate professional ethics, teamwork, and communication in industrial contexts.

## Learning Schedule

Since Field Work Practice is conducted outside campus (industry/institution), the schedule is project-based and guided by weekly consultations.

## Notes & Policies

- Attendance: Full-time engagement at assigned industry partner is mandatory. Absences must be formally justified.
- Reports: Weekly reports submitted via LMS (late submission not tolerated).
- Consultation: Regular consultation with academic supervisor is required.
- Evaluation: Based on industry supervisor assessment, academic supervisor evaluation, and final report + presentation.
- Ethics: Students must uphold professional behavior, confidentiality, and integrity during industrial placement.
